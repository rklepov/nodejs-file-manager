# Node.js [File Manager](https://github.com/AlreadyBored/nodejs-assignments/blob/main/assignments/file-manager/assignment.md)

_NOTE_: If a name of a file contains whitespace you can put it in double quotes to perform any supported operation on it:

```
cat "Documents and settings\My file.txt"
```

Otherwise the commands work as described in the assignment.
